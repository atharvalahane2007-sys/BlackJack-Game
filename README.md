Blackjack: The Basics
Blackjack is a classic casino card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Key Rules
Card Values: * Numbered cards (2-10) are worth their face value.

Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10.

Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on which helps your hand more.

The Deal: You and the dealer both start with two cards. One of the dealer's cards is dealt face-up (the "upcard"), while the other remains hidden.

Winning: You win if your total is higher than the dealer's without exceeding 21, or if the dealer "busts" (goes over 21).

Player Actions
On your turn, you have several choices:

Hit: Take another card to increase your total.

Stand: Keep your current cards and end your turn.

Double Down: Double your original bet in exchange for receiving exactly one more card.

Split: If you have two cards of the same value, you can split them into two separate hands (requires an additional bet).

The Dealer's Play
The dealer does not have a choice in how they play. In most versions, the dealer must hit until they reach a total of 17 or higher.

Special Outcomes
Blackjack: If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card, you have "Blackjack" and usually get paid 3:2 on your bet.

Push: If you and the dealer have the same total, it is a tie, and your bet is returned.

Bust: If your total exceeds 21, you lose immediately, even if the dealer later busts as well.# BlackJack-Game
